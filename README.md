# Telephone hybrid

![Schematic of two hybrids connected through their LINE pins](docs/hybrids.svg)

Telephone hybrids are circuits designed to send low-speed analog signals
bidirectionally using a single wire. Developed in the early 20th
century using transformer coils, their integrated counterparts use op-amps instead.

This repository contains the design files for an analog chip with two versions
of a simple, educational telephone hybrid, designed to be connected with each
other, targeting the Skywater 130nm process on the [Tiny Tapeout 9](https://tinytapeout.com)
shuttle.
